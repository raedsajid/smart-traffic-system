# Smart Traffic Management System

This project is a C++ implementation of a **Smart Traffic Management System** that simulates traffic flow, vehicle detection, user interaction, and automated challan generation based on rule violations. The application uses modular header files to implement various features like user portal, vehicle path management, and Stripe-based payment simulation.

## Features

- 🚦 **Traffic Control & Simulation**  
  Simulates vehicle movement and traffic signal behavior.

- 🧾 **Challan Generator**  
  Issues challans to users violating traffic rules.

- 🧍‍♂️ **User Portal**  
  Allows users to view and pay their challans.

- 💳 **Stripe Payment (Simulated)**  
  Mimics online payment using a stripe-like interface.

- 🧠 **Smart Logic**  
  Implements logic to monitor and control traffic using sensors and camera simulation.
  
## Requirements

- C++17 or later
- A graphics/GUI library if required by the implementation (e.g., `graphics.h`, SFML, etc.)
